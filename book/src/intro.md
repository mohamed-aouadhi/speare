# Introduction
This guide introduces `speare`, a Rust library for thread management and message passing. It focuses on practical applications of speare, covering process creation, message handling, and essential library features. The objective is to provide clear, concise instructions for effectively utilizing `speare` in your Rust projects.

## What is `speare`?
`speare` is a Rust library designed to simplify the process of actor-based concurrency. It provides an abstraction over [tokio tasks](https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial/spawning#tasks) (green threads) and [flume channels](https://github.com/zesterer/flume), allowing for easier management of threads and efficient message passing between them. With `speare`, each thread owns its data, reducing the risks of deadlocks and encouraging a modular design. No more `Arc<Mutex<T>>` everywhere :)
